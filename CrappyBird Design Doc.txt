Crappy Bird Design Document
----------------------------
-you play as a crappy bird
	-crappy bird has a few different animations
		-one for not moving
		-one for flapping
	-when crappy bird starts, crappy bird is gliding, no flapping animation, and there are no mario pipes, and
	the score is not yet displayed.
	-crappy bird spawns around the middle/left of the screen/view
-paralax scrolling 
-press spacebar or click to accelerate upwards
-there are pipes that the crappy bird has to manuever through
	-the pipes are of variable length
	-the distance or space between the pipes is fixed
	-they are always the same interval apart
-your score is saved whenever you hit something and crappy bird dies
	-your last score and your best score are displayed at the end
	-your score is always displayed when you are playing
	-at the end, a different score is displayed along with best
	-there are apparently leaderboards in the web version, but not going to 
	implement.
-whenever crappy bird hits something he falls and collides with the ground
	-he drops straight down and does not animate
-the screen dimensions are 400 x 600
